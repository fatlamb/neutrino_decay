## A class for management of the splines associated to the earth matter potential
# This class loads files storing splines for earth density and electron fraction,
# as well as a fictitious linear density profile, used for bug-checking.
# ye_spline is the electron fraction spline, corresponding to the differing 
# chemical composition at different earth radii. It is generated by YeSpline.py and 
# written into ye_spline.p. earth_spline is the earth density spline, generated
# by EarthDensity.py and written to earth_spline.p. line_spline is the test spline,
# generated by LinearSpline.y and written to line_spline.p
